#MT-pro-portfolio

#This is a rough draft of my professional portfolio. You will find an about me section, work that I have done and contact information.

My motivation was all the hard work I have yet to complete, and hoping to convey my creativity. This project was built to show future employers my potential. It helps eliminate any worries a future employer may have about my skills. I learned that I would like to continue learning and growing and applying those skills.

You can use the link provided to deploy my portfolio.
